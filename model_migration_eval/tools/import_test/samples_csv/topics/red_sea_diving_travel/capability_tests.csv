GEN_007,summarization,"Summarize the following trip report into 6 bullet points, focusing on Red Sea diving logistics and conditions (not personal drama). Text: ""We flew into Hurghada and drove to Safaga. The first day was windy and the boat ride was choppy, so we stayed closer to shore and did two easy reef dives with mild current. Visibility was about 15–20m. Day two we went farther out; the water felt cooler at depth and my buddy wished for a hood. We saw turtles and a big school of barracuda. Day three we planned a wreck but it was canceled due to weather; the operator offered a sheltered alternative and refunded the fuel surcharge. Nitrox was available but needed to be requested the day before. The marina required cash for port fees. Overall: great reefs, but bring a windbreaker and don’t overpack heavy clothes.""",low,"Produces exactly 6 bullets capturing key logistics/conditions: wind/chop, site selection, vis, temperature/hood, wildlife, wreck cancellation/weather policy, nitrox request timing, cash port fees, packing tip.

GEN_009,reasoning_capability,"I have 8 days total including travel. I want the best chance of seeing oceanic whitetips or hammerheads in the Egyptian Red Sea, but I get seasick easily and I’m only Advanced Open Water with 60 dives. Compare two approaches: (A) a northern wrecks-and-reefs liveaboard from Hurghada, (B) a shore-based trip in Marsa Alam with day boats (including Elphinstone if conditions allow). Recommend one with reasoning, and include 3 mitigation steps for seasickness that don’t involve prescription meds.",high,"Weighs pelagic likelihood vs comfort/safety/logistics and certification level. Recognizes that pelagic encounters are more likely in certain southern/offshore sites but conditions can be rough.
