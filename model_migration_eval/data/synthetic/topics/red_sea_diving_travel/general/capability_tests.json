It lies at around 30 meters and is usually dived from liveaboards or full-day boat trips from Sharm El Sheikh or Hurghada. The wreck is a World War II British cargo ship carrying trucks, motorbikes, ammunition, and other supplies, much of which is still visible in the holds. Currents can be moderate to strong, and visibility varies but is often around 20–30 meters. Divers typically do two dives here: one outside to see the structure and one inside the holds, which requires good buoyancy and awareness. It can be crowded with multiple boats, and conditions can change quickly, so it’s usually recommended for experienced divers with some wreck experience.\"",
