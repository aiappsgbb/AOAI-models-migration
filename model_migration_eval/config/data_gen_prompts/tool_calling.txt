Generate exactly {count} tool-calling/function-calling test scenarios for the topic: "{topic}".

Return a JSON object with a single key "scenarios" containing an array.
Each element MUST have this exact schema:
{{
  "scenarios": [
    {{
      "id": "TC_001",
      "scenario": "short_snake_case_name",
      "query": "A natural user request that may or may not require tool usage",
      "available_tools": [
        {{
          "type": "function",
          "function": {{
            "name": "tool_name",
            "description": "What the tool does",
            "parameters": {{
              "type": "object",
              "properties": {{
                "param1": {{"type": "string", "description": "Param description"}}
              }},
              "required": ["param1"]
            }}
          }}
        }}
      ],
      "expected_tool_calls": ["tool_name"],
      "expected_parameters": {{
        "tool_name": {{"param1": "expected_value"}}
      }},
      "complexity": "low|medium|high"
    }}
  ]
}}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ALL scenarios, tools, and queries must be domain-specific to "{topic}"
2. Include 2-4 available tools per scenario (realistic for the domain)
3. Include at least 1 scenario where NO tool is needed (expected_tool_calls: [])
4. Include at least 1 scenario requiring MULTIPLE sequential tool calls
5. Include at least 1 scenario where required parameters are MISSING from the query
6. Include at least 1 scenario with AMBIGUOUS tool selection
7. Tool definitions should be realistic and well-structured
8. Parameter types should vary (string, number, boolean, array)
9. Distribute complexity: ~25% low, ~50% medium, ~25% high
10. The "scenarios" array MUST contain EXACTLY {count} items — not more, not less
11. Return ONLY the JSON object with "scenarios" key — no markdown fences, no explanation
