Generate exactly {count} general capability test cases for evaluating AI models on the topic: "{topic}".

Return a JSON object with a single key "scenarios" containing an array.
Each element MUST have this exact schema (7 flat fields, CSV-compatible):

Variant A - Single-prompt test:
{{
  "scenarios": [
    {{
      "id": "GEN_001",
      "test_type": "reasoning_capability|instruction_following|structured_output|consistency|edge_case_handling|multi_language|safety_boundary|summarization|calculation_accuracy|persona_adherence|ambiguity_resolution|compliance_awareness|negative_sentiment_handling",
      "prompt": "The test prompt",
      "complexity": "low|medium|high",
      "expected_behavior": "Description of correct behavior",
      "conversation": "",
      "run_count": 1
    }}
  ]
}}

Variant B - Multi-turn test (conversation is a JSON-encoded string):
{{
  "scenarios": [
    {{
      "id": "GEN_008",
      "test_type": "context_retention",
      "prompt": "",
      "complexity": "medium",
      "expected_behavior": "Description of correct behavior",
      "conversation": "[{{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}}, {{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"...\"}}, {{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"...\"}}]",
      "run_count": 1
    }}
  ]
}}

FIELD RULES:
- "conversation" is either an empty string (Variant A) or a JSON-encoded string of an array of {{role, content}} objects (Variant B).
  Do NOT use a raw array - it MUST be a JSON-encoded string.
- Every item must have ALL 7 fields. Use empty string for unused fields.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ALL test content must be domain-specific to "{topic}" - adapt scenarios, numbers, terminology
2. Use at least 6 different test_types across the {count} items
3. Distribute complexity: ~30% low, ~45% medium, ~25% high
4. Include at least 1 structured_output test
5. Include at least 1 consistency test with "run_count": 5
6. Include at least 1 safety_boundary test relevant to the domain
7. Include at least 1 multi_language test
8. Include at least 1 calculation_accuracy test
9. All prompts should be realistic and testable
10. Return ONLY the JSON object with "scenarios" key - no markdown fences, no explanation, no comments inside the JSON
11. The "scenarios" array MUST contain EXACTLY {count} items - not more, not less
