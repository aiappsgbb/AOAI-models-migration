Generate exactly {count} realistic classification test scenarios for the topic: "{topic}".

Return a JSON object with a single key "scenarios" containing an array.
Each element MUST have this exact schema (7 flat fields, CSV-compatible):
{{
  "scenarios": [
    {{
      "id": "CLASS_001",
      "customer_input": "Realistic customer message (2-4 sentences)",
      "expected_category": "readable_snake_case",
      "expected_subcategory": "descriptive_subcategory",
      "expected_priority": "low|medium|high|critical",
      "expected_sentiment": "VALUE",
      "context": "{{\"key1\": \"value1\", \"key2\": \"value2\"}}"
    }}
  ]
}}

{category_block}

FIELD RULES:
- "context" is a JSON string (a stringified dict of domain-specific metadata).
  Example: "{{\"account_tenure_months\": 18, \"plan\": \"premium\"}}"
  - do NOT use a raw object; it MUST be a JSON-encoded string.

SENTIMENT VALUES (use exactly one of these):
  very_angry, angry, frustrated, concerned, worried, neutral, curious, cautious, positive, professional

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ALL scenarios, customer inputs, categories, subcategories, and contexts must be domain-specific to "{topic}"
2. Use at least 5 of your invented categories, distributing scenarios across them
3. Distribute priorities evenly: ~20% critical, ~30% high, ~30% medium, ~20% low
4. Mix sentiments realistically using ONLY the values listed above
5. Customer inputs must be natural, varied in tone and length
6. Context fields should contain domain-specific metadata as a JSON string
7. Return ONLY the JSON object with "scenarios" key - no markdown fences, no explanation, no comments inside the JSON
8. The "scenarios" array MUST contain EXACTLY {count} items - not more, not less
