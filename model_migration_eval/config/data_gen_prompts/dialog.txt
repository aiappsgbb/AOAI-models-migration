Generate exactly {count} realistic dialog/follow-up test scenarios for the topic: "{topic}".

Return a JSON object with a single key "scenarios" containing an array.
Each element MUST have this exact schema:
{{
  "scenarios": [
    {{
      "id": "DLG_001",
      "scenario": "short_snake_case_name",
      "conversation": [
        {{"role": "customer", "message": "..."}},
        {{"role": "agent",    "message": "..."}},
        {{"role": "customer", "message": "..."}}
      ],
      "context_gaps": ["gap1", "gap2"],
      "optimal_follow_up": "Best next agent response (detailed)",
      "follow_up_rules": ["rule1", "rule2"],
      "expected_resolution_turns": 2,
      "category": "readable_snake_case"
    }}
  ]
}}

{category_block}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ALL scenarios, conversations, and categories must be domain-specific to "{topic}"
2. Vary conversation lengths: some with 1 turn, some with 2-3 turns
3. Context gaps should reflect realistic missing information for the domain
4. Optimal follow-ups should be professional, empathetic, and specific
5. Create at least 4 distinct categories
6. Mix simple and complex dialog situations
7. Customer messages should be natural and varied
8. Return ONLY the JSON object with "scenarios" key — no markdown fences, no explanation, no comments inside the JSON
9. The "scenarios" array MUST contain EXACTLY {count} items — not more, not less
