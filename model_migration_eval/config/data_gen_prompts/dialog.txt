Generate exactly {count} realistic dialog/follow-up test scenarios for the topic: "{topic}".

Return a JSON object with a single key "scenarios" containing an array.
Each element MUST have this exact schema (6 flat fields, CSV-compatible):
{{
  "scenarios": [
    {{
      "id": "DLG_001",
      "conversation": "[{{\"role\": \"customer\", \"message\": \"...\"}}, {{\"role\": \"agent\", \"message\": \"...\"}}, {{\"role\": \"customer\", \"message\": \"...\"}}]",
      "context_gaps": "gap1 | gap2 | gap3",
      "optimal_follow_up": "Best next agent response (detailed)",
      "follow_up_rules": "rule1 | rule2 | rule3",
      "expected_resolution_turns": 2
    }}
  ]
}}

{category_block}

FIELD RULES:
- "conversation" is a JSON-encoded string of an array of {{role, message}} objects.
  Roles are "customer" or "agent".
- "context_gaps" is a pipe-separated string of information gaps (e.g. "gap1 | gap2").
- "follow_up_rules" is a pipe-separated string of follow-up rules (e.g. "rule1 | rule2").
- Do NOT use raw arrays or objects for these fields - they MUST be flat strings.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ALL scenarios, conversations must be domain-specific to "{topic}"
2. Vary conversation lengths: some with 1 turn, some with 2-3 turns
3. Context gaps should reflect realistic missing information for the domain
4. Optimal follow-ups should be professional, empathetic, and specific
5. Mix simple and complex dialog situations
6. Customer messages should be natural and varied
7. Return ONLY the JSON object with "scenarios" key - no markdown fences, no explanation, no comments inside the JSON
8. The "scenarios" array MUST contain EXACTLY {count} items - not more, not less
